stung is the Server for Transmitting Updated Nice Guidelines, designed to work
as a back-end for the Nice Guidelines app from openhealthcare.org. It will
allow clients to check whether updates are available for the guideline list and
serve those guidelines to the client.

When started, stung will open a UDP and TCP socket on port 14935. Clients can
send a datagram containing the client version number as 3 zero-padded digits
and a datagram reply will be sent with a hash of the contents of the most
up-to-date version of the guidelines list. If this does not match the value
stored on the client, the client should then negotiate a stream connection with
stung, ask for the relevant file ("GET hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh") and
download. If the client requests the wrong file the connection will be closed
by stung.

Periodically, stung will poll a directory looking for updated guidance lists.
The lists are expected to be gzipped xml files following a strict naming
convention:

- vvvhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.gz

...where vvv is the zero-padded decimal version of the oldest client which can
interpret the file and hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh is the MD5 hash of the
file contents. If there are 2 or more files with the same vvv prefix stung will
only recognize the last by alphanumeric order. As this may not be the newest
file, it is the responsibility of the scraper routine to clear up obsolete
files.

Usage:
	stung <directory-to-watch>
